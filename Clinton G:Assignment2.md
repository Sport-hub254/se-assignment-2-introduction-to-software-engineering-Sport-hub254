ANSWERS TO SE ASSIGNMENT 2:
1. Define Software Engineering: a scientific study that involves building computer softwares using engineering principles, methods and tools.
2. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is a modern discipline that relies on computer science and technology and allows continuous improvement of softwares and processes while traditional engineering involves known and tested methods and follows a systematic linear approach and deals in tangible projects like building and machines. 
3. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): a model describing the flow of work or activities from start to end in creating a working software. It involves requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.
4. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
i) Requirements - it entails identifying user needs which are the challenges a client is trying to solve or eradicate.
ii) Design – it involves preparing a blueprint of the expected work and if the software will achieve needs of the user. Design further looks into feasibility of the project in terms of financial, technological and practicality.  
iii) Implementation – developers are tasked to writing code and building the software according to the user needs. Considered as the longest in all the stages of the life cycle, the code is written in the specified languages chosen.
iv) Testing – this stage ensures the created software meets agreed upon standards and performs as expected. It involves quality assurance controls. For example, Microsoft contracts developers globally to test their operating system before release date or deployment
v) Deployment – at this stage the program is ready to use and is released to the client for use
vi) Maintenance – involves providing continuous support to the client or end users, uploading periodic updates to keep the systems secure, debugging, improvements, etc.

5. Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile model follows an iterative and incremental approach which is flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Waterfall model follows a sequential approach with distinct phases of the software development life cycle
6. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
 - Waterfall is good for short term projects while agile model is good for long term projects
i.	Waterfall: Emphasizes thorough, up-front documentation that outlines specifications, plans, and designs. 
Agile: Prioritizes functional software above copious documentation.
ii.	Waterfall: Progress reports and scheduled meetings in between stages allow for more formal communication.
Agile: Fosters continuous dialogue and cooperation between stakeholders and the development team.
iii.	Waterfall: This approach follows a sequential, linear path. Work is completed sequentially. It is challenging to implement changes once a stage is finished.
Agile: This method is gradual and iterative. Sprints are brief work cycles lasting 1-4 weeks during which new features are continuously delivered and often adjusted in response to user input.
iv.	Waterfall: Less adaptable and unable to change course as needed.
Agile: Extremely adaptable, thrives on taking in new data and changing requirements.
v.	Waterfall: Suitable for tasks requiring stringent regulatory compliance, defined timelines, and well-defined, consistent criteria.
Agile: Suitable for projects requiring quick iterations and deliveries, with an emphasis on early user input and changing needs.
	
7. Requirements Engineering: 
What is requirements engineering? It is an iterative process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders.
8. Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. The process entails requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specifications, requirements verification and validation and requirements management.
Some of requirements engineering importance include:
  i)Clear Vision and Communication 
 ii)Reduced Errors and Rework
iii)Targeted Development and Testing 
 iv)	Project Management and Success

9. Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. The process of breaking software up into discrete, independent modules, each in charge of a unique feature or capability. 
 How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? By separating functional boundaries, modularity facilitates improved code maintainability, scalability and reusability making complex systems simpler to administer and adapt.

10. Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing:
   i) Unit testing - it aims at examining every single unit of a software system in order to make sure that it meets the original requirements and functions as expected
  ii) Integration testing – it verifies whether the combined units work well together as a group and if the interconnections run effectively
 iii)	system testing - system testing includes user flows, performance and security and it is ran as a whole
  iv)	acceptance testing - it is the last stage of the testing process that ensures the software satisfies the end users’ needs before it is deployed or rolled out.

11. Why is testing crucial in software development? Software development seeks to assess and enhance software product quality.

11. Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. 

12. Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.  
   i) Git – creates backup, supports collaboration, free and open source, tracks history   
  ii) SourceForge – open source directory, analytics are completely free,users can review and recommend your project
 iii) Azure DevOps Server – discussion within work item forms, project wiki, linking of work items, commits, pull requests, and other objects to support traceability.

13. Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. 
They are the link between the client and the software developers working on a project. Their role includes project cost estimation, scheduling, staffing, software process customization, project monitoring and control, software configuration management, risk management, managerial report writing and presentation, and client interaction.   

14. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Key responsibilities of a software project manager includes task coordination, resource management, progress tracking, stakeholder communication, research and making sure the project is completed on schedule and within budget. 
Some of the challenges they face include:
   i) Unclear or Incomplete Requirements especially when needs are not well communicated
  ii) Poor Communication between team members, stakeholders, and the project manager can lead to misunderstandings, missed deadlines, and a decline in team morale
 iii) Lack of adequate resources including financial, labor or tools hindering quality of work
  iv) Unrealistic deadlines and estimates which creates risks of submitting low quality work 

15. Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. 
The continuous upkeep and updating of softwares after deployment to the end user. For example, Google Chrome sends update messages occasionally as a way to improve the program. It involves:
   i) Corrective – involves fixing defects 
  ii) Adaptive – involves adapting to the environment
 iii)	Perfective – involves enhancing attributes
  iv)	Preventive – involves preventing problems

16. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
Maintenance improves performance, enhances security of the program, UI/UX satisfaction thus it is essential in creating longevity of software developing businesses.

17. Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? 
  - Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life

18. How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Follow the general moral imperatives including honesty and trustworthiness in their work and also by avoiding harm to others. Software developers should strive for excellence, respect intellectual property and maintain confidentiality.
